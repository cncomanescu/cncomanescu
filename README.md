- 👋 Hi, I’m @cncomanescu
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a data analyst. I've started traning with Itonlinelearning since May 2023 but due to familiar commitments I had to pause my learning from October 2023 until June 2024. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on python and git. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a job on any company that will give me the opportunity to show what I'm capable of.
  I belive that I can achive the required level of expertise as a junior data analyst in no more than two weeks if I'm given the chance to learn on site.
  I'm prepared to do any sacrifyce that I have to, including working pro-bono for the two weeeks I'm training.
